# Compatible with PyTorch 2.0.x built from source
-r common.txt

# Note: torch, torchvision, torchaudio are NOT listed here because they
# must be built from source with TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="3.7" for K80 support.
# xformers is also excluded — it requires sm_70+.
# vllm-flash-attn is excluded — it requires sm_80+.

# Ray for pipeline parallelism (use compatible version)
ray>=2.9.0
