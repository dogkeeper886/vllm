# Build the Story #28 sm_37 CUTLASS SGEMM reproducer.
#
# Designed to run inside the K80 builder image (vllm37-builder:latest), which
# already has CUDA 11.4 + GCC 10 + CMake 4 + Python 3.10. The script:
#
#   1. Clones CUTLASS at the FetchContent-pinned tag (v4.0.0 per
#      vllm/CMakeLists.txt:302) into a scratch directory.
#   2. Applies sm37-trait.patch (Story #25, merged via PR #54).
#   3. Compiles sgemm_sm37.cu with nvcc, targeting sm_37.
#   4. Prints the resulting binary path + size for the caller.
#
# The runtime execution is intentionally NOT done here — see the
# k80-cutlass-repro CI workflow for the orchestration.
#
# Idempotent: re-running re-applies the patch via `git apply -3` so an
# already-patched tree doesn't trip up subsequent builds.
